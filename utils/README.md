## Description
This webpage is dedicated to creating a professional readme quick and easy. The main goal was to use node and javascript to generate a usable Readme; with all the sections that you need to include. After filling out the inquirer prompt in the terminal  a  READM.md  will be generated with everything that you filled out in the terminal. This is to make writing a working Readme very easy and painless.
